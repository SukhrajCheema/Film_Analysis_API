# films-network_analysis

This repository marks the start of a personal project in which I explore the metadata from 'TheMovieDatabase' (TMDB). The notebook in this repo demonstrates network analysis of cast similarity between film titles.

One can specifiy the number of pages (currently 100) to be retrieved from the API; with a greater number of pages resulting in longer data collection time. An interactive network diagram is shown at the bottom of the notebook after all cells have been run.
